- 🔔 **Real-time notifications** — Socket.IO-powered live notifications plus a global RxJS notification bus for instant UI feedback (success/error/info/warning).
- 📹 **Video consultation** — in-browser peer-to-peer audio/video calls using native **WebRTC**, with no third-party plugin required.

## 🧩 Domain Model

The application is built around a simple object model shared across the UI:

- **User** — base entity (id, name, email, password, phone, gender)
- **Patient**, **Doctor**, **Secretary** — extend `User` with role-specific fields (speciality/department for doctors, birthdate/address for patients, department for secretaries)
- **Appointment** — links a patient and a doctor with a date and a status (`requested → accepted → completed`)
- **Press (Prescription)** — links a patient and a doctor with prescription text

## 🔌  Back-end API 

The front-end was originally designed to consume a REST API (Spring Boot style) on `http://localhost:8080`, exposing endpoints such as:

- `POST /signin` — authentication
- `POST /ajouterUser` · `/ajouterPatient` · `/ajouterDoctor` · `/ajouterSecretary` — registration
- `GET /affichePatient` · `/afficheDoctoravecid` · `/afficheSecretaryavecid` · `/afficheUseravecid/:id` — fetch users
- `PUT /modifierpatient` · `DELETE /supprimepatient/:id` — update/delete patient
- `GET /afficheAppointment` · `POST /ajouterAppointment` · `PUT /modifierappointment` · `DELETE /supprimedoAppointment/:id` — appointment CRUD
- `POST /request` · `GET /requested` · `POST /accept/:id` · `GET /accepted` · `DELETE /complete/:id` — appointment workflow
- `GET /affichePres` · `GET /affichePresavecid/:id` · `POST /ajouterPres` · `PUT /modifierPres` · `DELETE /supprimePres/:id` — prescriptions
